# 🍺 Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. — Category Insights Analysis

### Overview
This notebook is a **self-directed analytics project** I created while applying for the **Category Insights Analyst** position at **Sierra Nevada Brewing Company**.  
It demonstrates how I approach retail and category data using Python, focusing on **sales growth, promotional impact, and market share performance**.

All data used in this project is **randomly generated synthetic data** designed to resemble real-world category sales patterns.  
No confidential or proprietary Sierra Nevada information was used — this is strictly for demonstration and portfolio purposes.
