# 🍺 Brewery Category Insights Analysis — Synthetic Data Project

## 📘 Overview
This notebook is a **self-directed analytics project** focused on the **beer and craft brewing industry**.  
It demonstrates how I use Python to analyze **category trends**, **promotional lift**, and **market share performance** — skills that are directly applicable to roles in category management, sales analytics, and consumer insights.

All data used in this project is **randomly generated synthetic data** designed to resemble real-world retail sales patterns in the beer category.  
No proprietary or confidential company information was used — this project is strictly for **demonstration and portfolio purposes**.

## 📈 Project Objectives

1. **Analyze category and brand growth trends**  
   - Identify which SKUs and package types are growing or declining in **units and dollars**  
   - Assess **price-to-volume dynamics** and the relationship between value and velocity  

2. **Benchmark brand vs. category performance**  
   - Compare brand sales growth against overall category trends  
   - Visualize **market share by region** and track shifts over time  

3. **Measure promotional effectiveness**  
   - Quantify **unit and dollar lift** during promoted vs. non-promoted periods  
   - Determine which SKUs respond most strongly to promotions and discounting

## 🧠 Key Insights (Summary)

- Certain **12-pack bottles** delivered the strongest promotional response  
  → **+53% dollar lift, +20% unit lift**, indicating strong promotional elasticity  
- Some SKUs showed **unit growth but dollar declines**, suggesting heavy discounting or trade-down behavior  
- **Regional share analysis** revealed consistent performance in core markets, with growth opportunities in underdeveloped regions

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- **Python** — Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Jupyter Notebook** — interactive exploration and analysis  
- **Visualization** — line charts, stacked bars, and share trend plots  
- **Markdown Storytelling** — concise executive summaries for each analytical step
