# 🍺 Category Insights Analysis — Synthetic Retail Data Project

## 📘 Overview
This notebook is a **self-directed analytics project** built to demonstrate my ability to analyze **retail and category performance** using Python.  
It showcases how I approach data-driven storytelling through **sales growth analysis**, **promotional impact measurement**, and **market share visualization**.

All data used in this project is **randomly generated synthetic data** created to resemble real-world category sales patterns.  
No proprietary or confidential company information was used — this project is intended solely for **demonstration and portfolio purposes**.

## 📈 Project Objectives

1. **Identify category and brand growth trends**  
   - Evaluate which brands and package types are growing or declining in **units and dollars**  
   - Measure correlation between volume and value growth to assess **pricing and mix dynamics**

2. **Benchmark brand vs. category performance**  
   - Compare brand sales trends against total category growth  
   - Analyze **market share by region** and visualize month-over-month share changes

3. **Quantify promotional lift**  
   - Measure **unit and dollar lift** during promoted vs. non-promoted periods  
   - Identify which SKUs respond most effectively to promotional activity

## 🧠 Key Insights (Summary)

- Certain **12-pack bottle SKUs** showed the strongest promotional response  
  → **+53% dollar lift, +20% unit lift**, indicating effective promotions and strong consumer pull  
- Some products exhibited **unit growth but dollar declines**, suggesting potential discounting or trade-down effects  
- **Regional performance varied**, with key markets showing strong category share and others presenting opportunity for improvement
